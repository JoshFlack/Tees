
# ask for radius input for calculation
r = input ( "please enter the radius of the circle ")
#making r and interger rather than a string to use for formula
r = int (r)
pi = 3.141592654

Answer = ("Area is: ", ((r **2) * pi))
#work out the answer by rasing the value of inte r by a power of 2, ie square it

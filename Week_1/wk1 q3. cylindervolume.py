#input and details for formula
r = input ("please input the radius of the cylinder ")
pi = 3.141
h = input ("please input the height of the cylinder ")

#casting inputs to ints
r = int (r)
h = int (h)

#formula to work out answer
Answer = (pi * r * h)

#print answer
print ("The answer is: ", Answer)
